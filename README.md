# Rag-pipeline-pdf

**Rag-pipeline-pdf** is a Python-based project implementing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** specifically for PDF documents. It combines traditional information retrieval techniques with AI-powered generation, allowing users to query large PDF datasets efficiently and get accurate, context-aware answers.

## Key Features

- **PDF Text Extraction:** Automatically extracts and preprocesses text from PDF documents.  
- **Vector Database Storage:** Uses ChromaDB to store embeddings of the extracted text for fast and efficient retrieval.  
- **RAG Pipeline:** Integrates retrieval with AI models to provide context-aware answers from the documents.  
- **Interactive Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks included for testing, exploring, and demonstrating the pipeline.  
- **Scalable & Modular:** Can be extended to larger datasets or integrated with other AI applications.  

## What I Did

- Built the end-to-end pipeline from PDF ingestion to AI query.  
- Implemented vectorization and storage for quick retrieval.  
- Enabled AI-assisted querying to fetch precise answers from PDFs.  
- Organized the project for easy experimentation and extension.  

This project serves as a base for building **intelligent document search systems** and can be extended to handle multiple document types or integrated into web applications.
